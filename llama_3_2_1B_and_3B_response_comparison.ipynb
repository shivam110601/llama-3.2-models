Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Initialize a counter variable\ncounter = 0\n\n# Initialize a flag variable\nstop_loop = False\n\n# For loop with a condition\nfor i in range(10):\n    if counter == 5:  # Condition to break the for loop\n        break\n    print(f\"Iteration {i}: {counter}\")\n    counter += 1\n\n# If the condition is not met, start a while loop\nif not stop_loop:\n    while counter < 10:\n        print(f\"Counter: {counter}\")\n        counter += 1\n```\n\nIn this code, the `for` loop runs 10 times. When `counter` reaches 5, the `break` statement is executed, and the `for` loop is exited. After that, a `while` loop starts and runs until `counter` reaches 10.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a `for` loop with a generator expression that contains a `while` loop:\n\n```python\n# Initialize a counter variable\ncounter = 0\n\n# For loop with a generator expression\nfor i in (i for i in range(10) if i < 5):\n    print(f\"Iteration {i}: {counter}\")\n    counter += 1\n```\n\nIn this code, the `for` loop runs only 5 times, and the `while` loop is not needed. The `if` condition inside the generator expression ensures that the loop only runs when `i` is less than 5."

While the intention was to address long-standing social and economic inequalities, the reservation system has also created challenges for General Category Indians. Some of the key challenges faced by General Category Indians due to reservation in India include:\n\n1. **Limited job opportunities**: Reservation policies often prioritize SCs, STs, and OBCs for government jobs, leading to limited opportunities for General Category Indians. This can result in a shortage of skilled and qualified candidates in the job market.\n2. **Competition and inequality**: The reservation system creates an uneven playing field, where General Category Indians face increased competition for limited spots. This can lead to feelings of resentment and inequality among those who feel they are being unfairly disadvantaged.\n3. **Lack of representation**: The dominance of reserved categories in government and educational institutions can result in a lack of representation for General Category Indians. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and marginalization among those who feel their voices are not being heard.\n4. **Inequitable distribution of resources**: Reservation policies can lead to an inequitable distribution of resources, such as scholarships, loans, and other forms of support. General Category Indians may feel that they are being denied opportunities due to the prioritization of reserved categories.\n5. **Perceived bias and favoritism**: Some General Category Indians may perceive the reservation system as biased or favoring certain groups over others. This can lead to feelings of mistrust and resentment towards the system.\n6. **Limited social mobility**: The reservation system can limit social mobility for General Category Indians, as they may face barriers in accessing education, job opportunities, and other resources that can help them climb the social ladder.\n7. **Economic disparities**: The reservation system can exacerbate economic disparities between General Category Indians and reserved categories. This can lead to feelings of frustration and disillusionment among General Category Indians who feel that they are being left behind.\n\nIt's essential to note that these challenges are not inherent to the reservation system itself but rather a result of its implementation and the complexities of the Indian social and economic landscape. Many advocate for a more nuanced approach to reservation, one that balances the needs of historically marginalized groups with the needs of General Category Indians and other marginalized groups."

Despite the country's official separation of church and state, many temples remain an integral part of the Indian fabric, particularly in the southern states where Hinduism is the dominant faith. These temples, often built and maintained by local communities, serve as vibrant centers of cultural and social activity, hosting festivals, processions, and rituals that bring people together. Moreover, many temples have evolved into institutions of education, healthcare, and social welfare, providing essential services to the local population. The Indian government's policy of secularism has allowed temples to coexist with other places of worship, such as mosques, gurudwaras, and churches, fostering a rich tapestry of diversity and promoting a sense of national unity."
